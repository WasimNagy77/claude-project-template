# Session Self-Assessment Template

## 🎯 Purpose & Context

**What This Is For:**
You are helping build a **bulletproof project management framework** for an AI-powered web development business. This framework will be used to deliver professional websites to real clients, on time, with consistent quality.

**Why This Matters:**
- Your user is building a **business** (not just a hobby project)
- Real **clients** depend on reliable processes
- **Money and reputation** are on the line
- A weak framework = missed deadlines, lost clients, failed business
- A strong framework = scalable business, happy clients, sustainable income

**The Goal:**
Extract EVERY valuable pattern, workflow, decision, and learning from this session so the framework becomes **production-ready**. This isn't academic - this is **business-critical infrastructure**.

**Your Role:**
You are the expert documenting what worked, what didn't, and what future sessions need to know. **Be thorough. Be honest. Be specific.** Generic answers are useless - we need actionable insights.

## Instructions for Completing This Assessment

**For AI in each session:**

1. **Read this entire template carefully**
2. **Analyze your full conversation history** with the user
3. **Fill out EVERY section** thoroughly - don't skip sections even if you think they don't apply
4. **Be specific** - use actual examples from the conversation
5. **Focus on reusability** - extract patterns, not project-specific details
6. **Be honest** - include what didn't work as well as what did
7. **Provide context** - explain WHY things matter, not just WHAT happened
8. **Save as:** `session-[number]-self-assessment.md` (where [number] is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
9. **Commit with message:** "docs: Add Session [N] self-assessment and learnings extraction"
10. **Push to repo** so it can be consolidated with other sessions

### Quality Check Before Submitting

- [ ] Every section has content (not [Fill in] placeholders)
- [ ] Specific examples provided (not generic statements)
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (not vague)
- [ ] Framework updates clearly identified (where things should go)
- [ ] Meta-analysis includes honest reflection
- [ ] File is saved with correct naming convention

**Expected time to complete:** 15-20 minutes for AI to analyze and fill out
**Value to framework:** Each session contributes unique learnings and patterns

---

## Consolidation Process (After All Sessions Complete)

Once all 4-5 sessions have completed their self-assessments:

1. **Review all assessment files** together
2. **Identify common patterns** across sessions
3. **Merge redundant learnings** (keep best version)
4. **Prioritize by frequency and impact** (if multiple sessions mention it, it's important)
5. **Update framework documents** with consolidated learnings
6. **Create FRAMEWORK-CONSOLIDATED.md** with master list of all patterns, workflows, and recommendations

---

**This is an AI-powered, automated extraction process. Each session analyzes itself and contributes to the collective framework knowledge base.**
