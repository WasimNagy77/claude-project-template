# Session Handoff - December 23, 2025

**To continue this session, tell Claude:**
> "Read the session handoff file at /home/wasim/Documents/SESSION-HANDOFF-Dec23-2025.md and continue from where we stopped"

## 📍 Where We Stopped

**Topic:** Brainstorming "Replit at Home" - solving Desktop vs Terminal friction

**We were exploring 7 options:**
1. **MCP Servers for Claude Desktop** - Add file access to Desktop via MCP
2. **Cursor IDE** - AI-native VS Code with Claude built-in
3. **Self-Hosted Replit alternatives** - code-server, Gitpod, Coder
4. **n8n + Claude API** - Workflow automation
5. **Continue.dev Extension** - Open-source AI assistant in VS Code
6. **Bolt.new / Lovable / v0.dev** - AI app builders (not self-hosted)
7. **Custom Stack** - Docker + code-server + Continue + n8n (full Replit dream)

**Questions I asked that need your answers:**
1. Do you have a server/VPS or just your PC?
2. Browser-based vs Desktop app preference?
3. How technical do you want to go? (A=Quick MCP, B=Cursor/Continue, C=Full custom stack)
4. Budget for tools?

## 🎯 Session Context Summary

### What We Accomplished Today

1. ✅ **Consolidated all 6 sessions** (4,184 lines of learnings)
   - Created: `/home/wasim/nail-candy-website/docs/COMPLETE-SESSION-CONSOLIDATION.md`
   - Discovered you were already using "one brain, 10 arms" pattern naturally

2. ✅ **Read your clarification answers** from `/home/wasim/Documents/Investigate session .txt`
   - Learned your actual workflow (ChatGPT spec → Desktop build → Terminal polish)
   - Learned you're a "learn fast, forget fast" person
   - Learned Nail Candy is YOUR business since 2012
   - Learned the real pain: session hangs + Desktop/Terminal friction

3. ✅ **Read Session 0** (6,080 lines!)
   - Found at: `/home/wasim/Documents/Session 0 content.txt`
   - Original 8-week proposal compressed to 2-3 days!
   - Desktop was for planning, Terminal for execution

4. ✅ **Identified main friction:** Desktop vs Terminal
   - Desktop: Easy UX, photos, writing - but no file access
   - Terminal: Full access - but harder UX
   - User wants: "Replit at home" - best of both worlds

5. 🔄 **Currently brainstorming** solutions for the friction
